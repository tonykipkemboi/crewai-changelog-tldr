New Release: CrewAI 1.1.0 is out! ðŸš¨

CrewAI version 1.1.0 (released 2025-10-21) delivers key enhancements for language model integration, developer experience, and vector search capabilities. However, please note several unresolved high-severity bugs and known issues that may affect critical workflows. Hereâ€™s what you need to know:

## Core Improvements & Fixes

- **Multi-provider Large Language Model (LLM) support**  
  Now supports multiple LLM backends in `InternalInstructor` and related classes, letting you choose the best model for your needs.  
- **mypy plugin base and stricter typing**  
  Improved static type checking makes code safer and easier to maintain, while surfacing parameter mismatches earlier.  
- **Template pinning**  
  Prevents unintentional changes to task/agent templates by enabling version locking.
- **Internal logging and tracing fixes**  
  Fixes to logging/tracing make debugging more reliable; improves error tracking in complex workflows.  
  - [Ongoing exception handling requests](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3755)
- **Dependency fixes**  
  - Integration documentation link corrections.
  - Addresses select import errors, but [litellm dependency](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3750) and [PGSearch import](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3776) remain open concerns.

## New Features & Enhancements

- **Qdrant Vector Search Tool upgrades**  
  Significant improvements to vector search and retrieval. However, be aware of reported [Qdrant regressions](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/issues/478) (test before upgrading).
- **Initial plugin framework**  
  The new mypy-compatible base sets the stage for community-built plugins.  
  - Typed tracing and safer validation for workflows and agent/job tasks.
- **Enhanced error surfacing (in progress)**  
  Work to improve error message clarity and exception handling is ongoing, following [community requests](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3755).
- **Better LLM integration options**  
  Seamless switching between providers; updated guides for Azure, Bedrock, and OpenAI compatibility.

**Still outstanding:**  
High-priority issues remain open for tool failures ([StageHand](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/issues/412), TXTSearch), async deadlocks ([#3730](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3730)), memory management ([#3753](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3753)), and context window errors ([#3774](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3774)).
