## 5. FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)

**Q1: How do I migrate from AgentOps after deprecation?**  
*Switch to built-in tracing. Follow the guide in [Docs on Tracing](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/tracing) or check [GitHub PR #1249](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1249). Test configs first.*

**Q2: What's new in memory features for v0.165.1?**  
*Agent_id linking in Mem0 improves targeted recall. See [Docs on Memory Systems](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/memory) and blog post on integrations.*

**Q3: Will the OpenAI pin affect my setups?**  
*It prevents import issues. Update cautiously; details in [GitHub PR #1239](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1239) and [Docs on LLM Integration](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/llms).*
